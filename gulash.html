        Is it a <strong>stew</strong>? Is it a <em>soup</em>? It sort of lies between the two in terms of the amount of broth vs the stuff in it. 
        Though one noticeable thing about traditional Goulash is that the broth is thinner than what you think of with stews, 
        and it’s not thickened with flour or cream. Also, it’s not typically served over mash like stews, it’s served in bowls like soup.
